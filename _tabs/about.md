# Who Am I ?

Owner: Eslam Hesham

My name is **Eslam Hesham**.

In 2023, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in **`Communication and Electronics`** from **Delta Higher Institute for Engineering and Technology**.

After that, I joined **`CyberTalents`**—starting with a one-month `*Introduction to Cybersecurity*` program, followed by a three-month `*Blue Team Bootcamp*`.

During this period, I gained hands-on experience in SOC analysis, threat hunting, SIEM use cases, log analysis, and digital forensics and incident response. The program concluded with a practical CTF challenge.

Between then and now, I completed my military service, which ended at the end of 2024.

It didn’t slow me down.

In 2025, I continued my development through **`WE Innovate Cybersecurity Academy`**, where I trained in SOC analysis and SOC engineering, ELK Stack implementation, detection engineering, SOAR, threat intelligence, Linux, Active Directory, and Red/Blue Team attack and defense scenarios.

Currently, I’m working as a **System Security Engineer at `Go Faster`**.

In this role, I support enterprise security environments at the **National Bank of Egypt**, where I worked on a project to install, deploy, and manage **Netwrix Change Tracker** for `File Integrity Monitoring`. This included building and maintaining a **three-node MongoDB cluster**, monitoring critical configuration files on Windows and Linux systems, and integrating alerts with SOC operations.

I also work with **`SecPod SanerNow`** for vulnerability assessment, asset scanning, and patch management across large-scale environments.

My focus is on security monitoring, detection engineering, and operational defense, with a clear goal of advancing further into **SOC engineering and real-time security operations**.
